    <p>Your goal is to make choices such that you will reach or exceed a point threshold by choosing between two options. For instance "reach 10 points in {{num_trials}} choices." Each option pays points with a certain probability; and there are two options. In the experiment you make repeated choices.

    <h3>Your task</h3>
    <p>Your task is to {{ if dfe_condition }} first <b>learn the probabilities of the options' points</b>, and then {{ endif }} make the <b>best choice that would best reach/exceed a point threshhold by the end of the remaining time</b>.<p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>The threshold will be shown like this. In the example you have 0 points and need to reach 29 points:</p>
    <div class = "flex-row">
        <div>
            <div>
                <img class = 'center' src='{% static "img/gain1E.png" %}' / width = '60%'>
{#                 <p class = 'example2E'>
                In the example you have 0 points and need to reach 29 points
                </p> #}
            </div>
        </div>
        </div>
    </div>
