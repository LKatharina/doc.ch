<p>
  Below you see one example option.
  This example option returns 7 points with a {{ if participant.condition < 4 }} hidden {{ endif }} probability of {{ if participant.condition < 4 }} <i>P</i> {{ else }} 20% {{ endif }} and 5 points  with a {{ if participant.condition < 4}} hidden {{ endif }} probability {{ if participant.condition < 5 }} <i>1 - P</i>{{ else }} 80%{{ endif }}. For instance, if 7 points have a {{ if participant.condition < 4 }} hidden {{ endif }} probability of 20% this means in 20 of 100 clicks the option returns 7 and in the remaining 80 of 100 clicks it returns 5, in the expectation. The probabilities remain constant. During the task you will see two options.

<p>
  On a first page, you will see the options{{ if participant.condition < 4}}.
    Click {{ participant.num_samples }} times on each option to learn about the hidden {{ if participant.format_condition == "dfe_np"}} probabilities of the outcomes {{ else }} outcomes and their probabilities {{ endif }}. Clicking on an option causes the clicked option to draw points according to the hidden probabilities.
  {{ else }}
     and the associated probabilities of the options' outcomes to familiarize yourself with the available options.
  {{ endif }}
    You do not accumulate any points here.
</p>

<p>
  On the next page, you will see the threshold that you have to reach in {{ C.NUM_TRIALS }} choices. Clicking on the option causes them to draw points according to the probabilities, and now you will accumulate points. The options will not change until you used up all {{ C.NUM_TRIALS }} clicks and have or have not reached the threshold.
